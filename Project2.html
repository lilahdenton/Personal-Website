<h1> Nextech: Happy Hygiene </h1>
    
    <p>
       Happy Hygiene is a mobile app that I developed with JavaScript to motivate children to participate in daily hygiene tasks. Coding this app earned me first place in the Intermediate Division of Nextech's Summer Coding Challenge in 2020. This was a 3-week virtual coding competition consisting of weekly meetings, planning, and coding events. I was tasked with the challenge of creating an application or website to solve a global or community health challenge. Submissions required a narrative, describing your implementation and ideology, as well as a video demonstration of your creation. </p>
