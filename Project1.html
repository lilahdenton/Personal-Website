<h1> Learning Management Discussion Board</h1>
    
    <p>
       This was a Group Project created for CS 18000 Object Oriented Programming in December 2021. We created a fully functional discussion board tool, similar to Brightspace or Canvas.  I was responsible for all of the front end development including the functionality of buttons, links, clicks, and other GUI implementation. I wrote the script for the video, screen recorded our running program, and edited the video together using Final Cut Pro X. </li>
  Below are the logisitics for the project as well as a video demonstration of our final product and our presentation.</p>

         Fun Fact: I recorded my portion of this video from home and was extremely sick. For those that do not know me, I don't normally sound that congested :)
