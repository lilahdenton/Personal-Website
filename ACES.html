    My time at ACES as their Software Engineer Intern was both enriching and insightful. It provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the corporate world and emphasized the pivotal role of software in business operations. As a member of the Development team, I was introduced to senior engineers whose wealth of experience was truly inspiring.
Throughout the summer, I was stationed at ACES National Headquarters in Carmel, IN, near Indianapolis. A typical day as an intern involved regular check-ins with my manager and the meticulous handling of tickets through Jira. My responsibilities encompassed enhancing various systems through the implementation of feature requests, bug fixes, and the conceptualization of improvement strategies. Notably, my proficiency extended to utilizing SQL, C#, and Microsoft Visual Studio in executing these tasks.
Towards the conclusion of the internship, I seized the opportunity to deliver an Intern Presentation that I titled "Artificial Intelligence: Embracing the Change" to an esteemed audience, including the CEO, Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents, and other ACES personnel. This presentation delved into the potential positive and negative impacts of AI on companies, particularly those, like ACES, in the foreseeable future.
Following the presentation, the Senior Vice President extended the offer for me to continue my contributions through an extended remote internship during the 
Fall and Spring semesters, subsequent to the on-site internship. This experience has undoubtedly been instrumental in shaping my professional growth and solidifying my commitment to the field of software engineering.</p>
